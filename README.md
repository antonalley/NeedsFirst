# NeedsFirst

This project started from a Hackathon Event at BYU, and was created in less than 10 hours. Because of the time restraint I just added the backend, 
which uses a Django-REST framework, and the React js front end to the same repository.


### Backend Setup
* In the api directory, initialize python virtual environment, then
* ~/needs_first_api/needs_first/ $ pip install -r requirements.txt
* ~/needs_first_api/needs_first/ $ python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000


### Frontend Setup (Default runs on port 3000)
* Install node, make sure it is a current version
* ~/needs_first_react/needs_first/ $ npm install
* ~/needs_first_react/needs_first/ $ npm start
